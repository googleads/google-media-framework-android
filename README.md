# Google Media Framework for Android

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/googleads/google-media-framework-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/googleads/google-media-framework-android)

## Introduction
The Google Media Framework (GMF) is a lightweight media player designed to make video playback and integration with the Google Interactive Media Ads (IMA) SDK on Android easier.

The framework is currently in beta, allowing interested developers to try it out and send feedback before we finalize the APIs and features.

## Features
- A customizable video player UI for video playback on Android
    - Logo and branding colors
    - Action buttons within video UI for other actions (ex. share or download)
    - Subtitle support
- Easily integrate the Google IMA SDK to enable advertising on your video content
- Built on top of [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)
    - Plays [MPEG DASH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP), [HLS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) and mp4, and easily extended to other video formats

## Getting started

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/googleads/google-media-framework-android.git GoogleMediaFramework
```

Then import the project in Android Studio (or build using Gradle via `./gradlew`).

### Via jCenter
You can also include GMF by adding the following in your project's `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
compile 'com.google.android.libraries.mediaframework:mediaframework:X.X.X'
```
where `X.X.X` is the version. For the latest version, see the
project's [Releases][]. For more details, see the project on [Bintray][].

[Releases]: https://github.com/googleads/google-media-framework-android/releases
[Bintray]: https://bintray.com/google/google-media-framework-android/mediaframework/view

_Note:_ this installs the underlying `mediaframework` library. For the demo package with IMA
integration, please download or clone the source.
